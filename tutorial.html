      <p>The <a href="viewer.html">Viewer</a> displays an image from a single DECam CCD for you to inspect.
      Two primary buttons are provided:</p>
      <button id="fine-button" class="btn btn-success">Next</button>
      <!--#include file="problem_selector.shtml"-->
      <p style="margin-top:10px">
      If there are no obvious issues with the image displayed, simply press <span style="font-weight: bold; color:#46a546">Next</span>. 
      Otherwise, click the <span style="font-weight: bold; color:#9d261d">Problem</span> button and select one of the predefined problem categories. 
      Click on the problematic location(s) to mark the image.
      Once you are done marking all problems, click <span style="font-weight: bold; color:#46a546">Next</span> to submit the problems and advance to the next image.

      <a id="column-mask-anchor"></a>
      <h3>Column Mask</h3>
      <p> There are a number of columns that behave differently than their neighbors.
        Often this occurs when a hot pixel in the column bleeds over during readout. 
        We attempt to mask these columns with a "bad pixel mask" and it is useful to know when we are missing bad columns.

      <a id="cosmic-ray-anchor"></a>
      <h3>Cosmic rays</h3>
      <p>Cosmic-ray contamination is unavoidable in our deep red-sensitive CCDs.
      The good thing about unmasked cosmic rays: they are easy to spot.
      Unmasked cosmic rays should become apparent when you use the
      <button class="btn btn-small btn-info">Toggle <u>s</u>caling</button> button
      to switch to a scaling that focuses on the bright aspects of the image and the
      <button class="btn btn-small btn-info">Toggle <u>m</u>ask</button> to blink the existing mask.
      It's perfectly fine to mark multiple cosmic rays per image,
      including those that are only partially masked.</p>

      <a id="cross-talk-anchor"></a>
      <h3>Cross-talk</h3>
      <p>Cross-talk is a readout issue, which occurs in the electronics.
      The visual imprint of cross-talk is a long, horizontal excess of counts,
      typically several pixels wide and often widest in the middle section.
      When the cross-talk
      occurs on a single chip, there should be a bright object on the other side
      of the horizontal A/B transition.
      </p>
      <p>Since cross-talk scales with the brightness of the object that
      cause it, only the brightest objects (typically stars) will leave a clearly
      visible imprint. Toggle the image scaling to dig deeper into noise. Since the feature can be very extended,
      mark the region where it has it's widest vertical extension: the knot in the middle.

      <a id="edge-bleed-anchor"></a>
      <h3>Edge-bleed</h3>
      <p> Very bright stars saturate the readout electronics leading to bright bleeds on the readout side of the CCD.
        Edge-bleeds should be automatically identified and masked with a rectangular strip.
        If this mask is too big, too small, or not present at all, please tag the location of the error.

      <h3>Excessive mask</h3>
      <p> Occasionally large regions of a CCD get masked for no apparent reason.
        Sometimes this is a failure in edge-bleed masking, other times the cause is uncertain.
        Toggle the mask and flag excessive masks when you see them.

    </div>
    <div class="span7">
      <a id="dark-rim-anchor"></a>
      <h3>Dark rim</h3>
      <p> It is fairly common for dark regions to appear in the corners and around the edges of images.
        These reflect an over-subtraction of the sky background in these regions.
        These dark rims are often correlated with bright stars or dense fields.
      </p>

      <p> Dark halos occasionally appear surrounding bright objects. 
        This results from the sky background being over-estimated close to these objects.

      <a id="Quilted-sky-anchor"></a>
      <h3>Quilted sky</h3>
      <p> Occasionally images show strong rectilinear patterning, and in the worst cases a CCD will appear as a 4x8 quilt of light and dark regions.
        This quilting is introduced by a mismatch in the normalization factor between the pupil and illumination correction (both of which are calculated in 512 pixel blocks).
        This artifact often appears strongest near the sides of the CCD, and can manifest itself as a single vertical line inset by roughly 1/8th of a CCD length.

      <h3>Wavy sky</h3>
      <p> Wavy sky appears as large-scale structures contributing a high-level of sky background.
        These features are often correlated over the entire focal plane and can occur for several exposures in a row (they may be the result of poor observing conditions).
        We don't understand the root cause of this this yet...

      <h3>Anti-bleed</h3>
      <p> Anti-bleeds are dark streaks extending vertical from bright stars towards the long edges of the CCD.
        They have a width roughly comparable to the masked region of the star.
        They appear in the reduced images themselves and are thus not purely an artifact of the sky background subtraction.

      <a id="ab-jump-anchor"></a>
      <h3>A/B jump</h3>
      <p> The top and bottom halves of the DECam CCDs are read out by two different amplifiers.
        The gains on these amplifiers are different leading to a different background level on the two halves of each CCD.
        This should be corrected for in flat fielding; however, a failure can lead to a strong change in the background level at the horizontal mid-plane of the CCDs.
        This is most pronounced with the low-light-level non-linearity of CCD 31.

      <h3>Fringing</h3>
      <p> Fringes are an interference pattern that occur at red wavelengths when the CCDs become transparent (think of the fringes on the surface of an oily puddle). 
        Fringes are known to be variable (relative to the rest of sky brightness) and the pipeline does not currently deal with them too well.
        They occur most commonly in the z-band.

      <a id="tape-bump-anchor"></a>
      <h3>Tape bump</h3>
      <p> The silicon wafers are attached to the CCD backplanes by six pieces of double-sided tape (three along each long edge of the CCD).
        Physical stresses on the silicon lattice distort the electric field in these regions changing the effective size of the pixels in these regions.
        A failure in flat-fielding can lead to one or often more of these tape bumps being visible in the reduced image.

      <a id="tree-rings-anchor"></a>
      <h3>Tree rings</h3>
      <p> Tree rings are concentric, circularly symmetric features arising changes in the effective pixel size resulting from transverse electric fields in the CCDs.
        Tree rings originate from variations in the doping impurities during single-crystal silicon growth.
        Thus, the tree ring pattern of each CCD will depend on its relative position in the silicon wafer.
        Tree rings appear most strongly in the z-band.

      <a id="vertical-jump-anchor"></a>
      <h3>Vertical jump</h3>
      <p>
        The vertical jump arises from the incorporation of a few bad flats into the calibration sets.
        These flats contain a strong gradient caused by the shutter failing to close during readout.
        Due to the clipping algorithm when combining multiple flats, this results in a vertical "jump" near the center of flat-fielded images.
        More information on the vertical jump feature can be found <a href="https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/desdmug/wiki/Central_Bias_Jump">here</a>.

      <h3>Bright spray</h3>
      <p> The worst scattered light features come bright off-axis stars scattering off of the wall of the shutter.
        This leads to broad bright sprays fanning out from the edge of the focal plane.
        These features can be most easily identified on the full focal plane images via the <button class="btn btn-small btn-info">Info</button> button.
        After Year 1, we applied an anti-reflective paint to the shutter wall and this issues should be corrected for Year 2 and beyond.

      <h3>Ghosts</h3>
      <p>Ghost are reflections off the internal camera optics. 
        They dominantly appear when a bright object is in the field of view and often occupy very large areas (from parts of a chip to the entire focal plane).
        Small ghosts can be identified on a single chip by their characteristic "tie-fighter window" pattern; however, often it is helpful to look at images of the full focal play.

      <h3>Satellite</h3>
      <p>Satellite, orbital stages of rockets, and other reflecting bodies
      often cross our focal plane.
      They create long, unsaturated streaks on the images, much longer and wider than cosmic rays. Since they are so
      large, you can mark the track wherever you want. Sometimes, however, 
      the tracks are broken into segments (note: <a href="http://www.satobs.org/tumble/tumbleintro.html">rocket parts may tumble</a>),

      <h3>Airplane</h3>
      <p> Unfortunately, CTIO lies along a regional Chilean airline flight path. 
        We expect that roughly 15 planes will cross the DECam focal plane per season. 
        Planes have a much larger impact that satellites, often destroying the sky background estimation.
        When lights on a airplane blink, they appear as out-of-focus donuts (and can be used to determine the height of the plane...).
        Slightly more information on airplanes can be found <a href="https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/desdmug/wiki/Airplanes">here</a>.

        These issues will hopefully be solved in Year 1.

      <h3>Shutter Failure</h3>
      <p> Star bleeds are often symptomatic of the camera being readout with the shutter still open.
        Star bleeds caused by shutter errors can be identified by looking at the full focal plane image, where the direction of the star bleeds will change between the top and bottom of the focal plane (due to a switch in the readout direction).
        Shutter errors should be solved by Year 2.

        These issues should be fixed early in SV.

      <h3>Haze</h3>
      <p> Haze appears as large diffuse blurs around bright objects.
      It affects the entire focal plane and can thus be seen well from the FoV images.
      The reason could be a slightly overcast sky, but we don't fully understand the root cause of this this yet...

      <h2>Other...</h2>
      <p>Sometimes none of the existing categories fit. 
        In this case, you can describe the problem in your own words.
        Please do so in a way that is as comprehensible and consistent as possible (e.g., if you see feature multiple times, try to use the same description). 
        We will give you a list of free-word categories of other users so that you can see what kinds of problems have been found so far.
