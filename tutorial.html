      <h1>Tutorial</h1>
      <p>The <a href="viewer.html">Viewer</a> displays an image from a single DECam CCD for you to inspect.
        If there are no obvious issues with the image, simply press "Next". 
        If not, click the "Problem" button and select one of the predefined categories. 
        Click on the problematic location to mark it on the image. Please mark both false negative and false positive instances of artifacts (e.g., use "Edge-Bleed" to mark both an edge-bleed without an edge-bleed mask and a edge-bleed mask without an edge-bleed).
        Once you are done marking all problems, click "Next".

      <div class="span6">
        <a id="column-mask-anchor"></a>
        <h3>Column Mask</h3>
        <p> There are a number of columns that behave differently than their neighbors.
          Often this occurs when a hot pixel in the column bleeds over during readout. 
          We attempt to mask these columns with a "bad pixel mask" and it is useful to know when we are missing bad columns.

        <h3>Cosmic rays</h3>
        <p>Cosmic-ray contamination is unavoidable in our deep red-sensitive CCDs and we would like to properly mask it.
        The good thing about cosmic rays: they are easy to spot.</p>

        <p>Use the buttons shown above to switch to a scaling that focuses on the
        bright aspects of the image and to blink the mask, and the cosmic rays will become very apparent.
        It's perfectly fine to mark multiple cosmic rays per image
        (including those that are only partially masked) or
        multiple different problems on the same image.</p>

        <a id="cross-talk-anchor"></a>
        <h3>Cross-talk</h3>
        <p>Cross-talk is a readout issue, which occurs in the electronics.
        The visual imprint of cross-talk is a long, horizontal excess of counts,
        typically several pixels wide and often widest in the middle section.
        When the cross-talk
        occurs on a single chip, there should be a bright object on the other side
        of the horizontal A/B transition.
        </p>
        <p>Since cross-talk scales with the brightness of the object that
        cause it, only the brightest objects (typically stars) will leave a clearly
        visible imprint. Toggle the image scaling to dig deeper into noise. Since the feature can be very extended,
        mark the region where it has it's widest vertical extension: the knot in the middle.

        <p> Very bright stars saturate the readout electronics leading to bright bleeds on the readout side of the CCD.
          Edge-bleeds should be automatically identified and masked with a rectangular strip.

        <a id="dark-rim-anchor"></a>
        <h3>Dark rim</h3>
        <p> It is fairly common for dark regions to appear in the corners and around the edges of images.
          These reflect an over-subtraction of the sky background in these regions.
          These dark rims are often correlated with bright stars or dense fields.

        <p> Dark halos occasionally appear surrounding bright objects.

        <h3>Quilted sky</h3>
        <p> Occasionally images show strong rectilinear patterning, and in the worst cases a CCD will appear as a 4x8 quilt of light and dark regions.
          This quilting is introduced by a mismatch in the normalization factor between the pupil and illumination correction (both of which are calculated in 512 pixel blocks).
          This artifact often appears strongest near the sides of the CCD, and can manifest itself as a single vertical line inset by roughly 1/8th of a CCD length.

        <p> Wavy sky appears as large-scale structures contributing a high-level of sky background.
          These features are often correlated over the entire focal plane and can occur for several exposures in a row (they may be the result of poor observing conditions).

        <h3>Anti-bleed</h3>
        <p> Anti-bleeds are dark streaks extending vertical from bright stars towards the long edges of the CCD.
          They have a width roughly comparable to the masked region of the star.
          They appear in the reduced images themselves and are thus not purely an artifact of the sky background subtraction.

        <h3>A/B jump</h3>
        <p> The top and bottom halves of the DECam CCDs are read out by two different amplifiers.
          The gains on these amplifiers are different leading to a different background level on the two halves of each CCD.
          This should be corrected for in flat fielding; however, a failure can lead to a strong change in the background level at the horizontal mid-plane of the CCDs.
          This is most pronounced with the low-light-level non-linearity of CCD 31.

          Fringes are known to be variable (relative to the rest of sky brightness) and the pipeline does not currently deal with them too well.
          They occur most commonly in the z-band.

        <h3>Tape bump</h3>
        <p> The silicon wafers are attached to the CCD backplanes by six pieces of double-sided tape (three along each long edge of the CCD).
          Physical stresses on the silicon lattice distort the electric field in these regions changing the effective size of the pixels in these regions.
          A failure in flat-fielding can lead to one or often more of these tape bumps being visible in the reduced image.

        <a id="tree-rings-anchor"></a>
        <h3>Tree rings</h3>
        <p> Tree rings are concentric, circularly symmetric features arising changes in the effective pixel size resulting from transverse electric fields in the CCDs.
          Tree rings originate from variations in the doping impurities during single-crystal silicon growth.
          Thus, the tree ring pattern of each CCD will depend on its relative position in the silicon wafer.
          Tree rings appear most strongly in the z-band.

        <a id="vertical-jump-anchor"></a>
        <h3>Vertical jump</h3>
        <p>
          The vertical jump arises from the incorporation of a few bad flats into the calibration sets.
          These flats contain a strong gradient caused by the shutter failing to close during readout.
          Due to the clipping algorithm when combining multiple flats, this results in a vertical "jump" near the center of flat-fielded images.
          More information on the vertical jump feature can be found <a href="https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/desdmug/wiki/Central_Bias_Jump">here</a>.

        <p> The worst scattered light features come bright off-axis stars scattering off of the wall of the shutter.

        <h3>Satellites</h3>
        <p>Satellite, orbital stages of rockets, and other reflecting bodies
        often cross our focal plane.
        They create long, unsaturated streaks on the images, much longer and wider than cosmic rays. Since they are so
        large, you can mark the track wherever you want. Sometimes, however, 
        the tracks are broken into segments (remember: <a href="http://www.satobs.org/tumble/tumbleintro.html">rocket parts may tumble</a>),
        in which case we'd like to have marks on each of the segments.

        <h3>Airplanes</h3>
        <p> Unfortunately, CTIO lies along a regional Chilean airline flight path. 
          We expect that roughly 15 planes will cross the DECam focal plane per season. 
          Planes have a much larger impact that satellites, often destroying the sky background estimation.
          When lights on a airplane blink, they appear as out-of-focus donuts (and can be used to determine the height of the plane...).
          Slightly more information on airplanes can be found <a href="https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/desdmug/wiki/Airplanes">here</a>.

        <h3>Shutter Failure</h3>
        <p> Star bleeds are often symptomatic of the camera being readout with the shutter still open.
          Star bleeds caused by shutter errors can be identified by looking at the full focal plane image, where the direction of the star bleeds will change between the top and bottom of the focal plane (due to a switch in the readout direction).
          Shutter errors should be solved by Year 2.

      <h3>Failure</h3>
      <p>Sometimes a large portion of the entire image is affected by, well, something.
      It would be too bothersome to mark each single feature on such an image, and
      even if, it would probably be hard to train a piece of software to distinguish between
      the contaminated parts and the usable rest. So, we'll settle for finding them first.
      </p>
      <p>Before marking an image as catastrophic failure, please make sure that it is not just
      a conincidence of several other features. As a guideline, estimate the remaining usable
      area after everything problematic has been masked (which may or may not be the case in
      the image you're are looking at). If this remainder is less than 50%, mark the image
      as catastrophic.</p>
