      <h1>FAQ</h1>
      <p>Things can get confusing sometimes, problems do no appear to fit into any given category, etc.
        We try to answer a couple of re-ocurring questions here and additional questions can be found on
	the redmine forum <a href="https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/desdmug/wiki/Problem_classes_from_the_SV-A1_eyeball_website">here</a>.
        If you have a question that may be of broader interest to the community, post it on the redmine
	forum or email it directly to the <a href="#" id="email-anchor">DES exposure checker folks</a>. 
        For technical requests (bugs or improvements to the website), open a
	<a href="https://github.com/pmelchior/des-exp-checker/issues">github issue</a>.

      <h3>Why doesn't the DES password work?</h3>
      <p>It does, otherwise you wouldn't be able to see this page. You can browse all pages
      and load any image in our database into the viewer. But if you want to
      submit problems you see in these images, you need your own account for this website.
      Go to the <a href="index.html">start page</a> and create it, it's very straightforward.<br>
      And don't worry if you see something worthwhile reporting, but then have to login first:
      we'll bring you back to that image after you've logged in or signed up.
      </p>
      
      <h3>What happens with my submissions?</h3>
      <p>If your are logged in on this website, your submissions are recorded.
      In this case, clicking on the button <button class="btn btn-small btn-success">Next</button> without
      having marked anything tells us that you think the image is fine. It's not a problem if you
      missed something on the image or you hit the button accidentially, since we don't have to
      be complete in finding problems, we seek to be reliable when we state that something is problematic.</p>
      
      <h3>False positives vs false negatives?</h3>
      <p>We would like to know about any kind of flaw in the data. Therefore, please
      mark both false negative and false positive instances of artifacts
      (e.g., use "Edge-Bleed" to mark both an edge-bleed without an edge-bleed
      mask and a edge-bleed mask without an edge-bleed). 
      </p>
      
      <h3>What's up with the underlined letters on buttons?</h3>
      <p>Any underlined letter on a button, like these ones</p>
      <p>
        <button class="btn btn-info">Toggle <u>m</u>ask</button>
        <button class="btn btn-info">Toggle <u>s</u>caling</button>
      </p>
      <p>indicates that you can use a keyboard shortcut, namely <strong>Alt+m</strong>
      or <strong>Alt+s</strong> in these two cases.
      <span class="muted">Hint for Mac users: Alt = Opt</span>
      </p>
      
      <h3>What are those dots in the column masks?</h3>
      <p> Very hot pixels will overflow into downstream pixels during readout creatig a "bad column".
        Additionally, cross talk creates hot pixels spaced every 60 pixels upstream (towards the readout side) of the hot pixels. 
        This appears as a dotted mask upstream of a truncated bad column mask.
        These dots are not actually a problem class.
        For some more details see <a href="http://des-docdb.fnal.gov:8080/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=6989">here</a>.
      </p>
      
      <h3>I can't see the images. What's wrong?</h3>
      Very likely your browser doesn't support the way we load the images. Safari version 5
      is an example for this lack of implementation of a nominally supported functionality.
      In this case, please use another/newer browser instead.
